# Exploratory-data-analysis-of-Sleep-Health-and-Lifestyle-Dataset
The EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) of the sleep health and lifestyle dataset revealed several interesting insights. Here is a summary of the key findings:
        Females exhibit a higher vulnerability to sleep disorders, particularly sleep apnea, while sleep duration remains comparable between genders. On average, individuals with sleep apnea have a higher heart rate of 73.09, compared to 69.02 for those without a sleep disorder. Similarly, individuals with insomnia have an average heart rate of 70.47.Sleep quality is notably better in females compared to males.

Occupationally, sales representatives experience poorer sleep quality than other professions.
The age group of 40-49 demonstrates a higher prevalence of insomnia.
Physical activity and sleep quality demonstrate a positive correlation, implying that higher physical activity levels contribute to better sleep quality.
 Stress levels are also higher in individuals with sleep disorders. The average stress level for individuals with insomnia is 5.87, and for sleep apnea, it is 5.67. Comparatively, those without a sleep disorder have an average stress level of 5.11.
These insights enhance our understanding of sleep health and its connections with gender, occupation, age, physical activity, and specific sleep disorders
